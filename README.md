# 🧠 PDF-RAG: Combining Vector Search and LLMs for Smarter Document Interaction


**PDF-RAG** is an AI-powered system that enables natural language querying over PDF documents. Leveraging **LangChain**, it integrates vector-based semantic search with language generation models to retrieve and generate contextually relevant answers from your PDFs. The pipeline involves extracting embeddings from uploaded documents, performing similarity searches against these embeddings, and using those results as context to produce precise, grounded responses.
